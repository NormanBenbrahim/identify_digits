# Identify digits in images using OCR

Based on the following tutorial: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/10/an-introduction-to-implementing-neural-networks-using-tensorflow/

# Tips from the article:

Neural networks is a special type of machine learning (ML) algorithm. So as every ML algorithm, it follows the usual ML workflow of data preprocessing, model building and model evaluation. For the sake of conciseness, I have listed out a TO DO list of how to approach a Neural Network problem.

* Check if it is a problem where Neural Network gives you uplift over traditional algorithms (refer to the checklist in the section above)
* Do a survey of which Neural Network architecture is most suitable for the required problem
* Define Neural Network architecture through which ever language / library you choose.
* Convert data to right format and divide it in batches
* Pre-process the data according to your needs
* Augment Data to increase size and make better trained models
* Feed batches to Neural Network
* Train and monitor changes in training and validation data sets
* Test your model, and save it for future use
